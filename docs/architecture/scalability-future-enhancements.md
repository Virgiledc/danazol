# Scalability & Future Enhancements

## 12.1 MVP to Production Path

1. **MVP (Current):** Local app, Supabase storage, manual deployment
2. **Phase 2:** Cloud-hosted web app, user accounts, team collaboration
3. **Phase 3:** SaaS offering, white-label, advanced features
4. **Phase 4:** Mobile app, advanced customization dashboard

## 12.2 Technical Debt & Refactoring

- Consider separating Claude prompt logic into dedicated service
- Move to microservices if scaling significantly
- Implement caching layer (Redis) for frequently generated designs
- Add analytics to track usage patterns
