# Goals & Background

## 1.1 Goals

1. Enable rapid website generation for businesses from minimal input data
2. Create visually distinct, sector-specific designs (not template-based)
3. Minimize your manual effort (10 mins input per site)
4. Generate production-ready websites deployable in 1 hour
5. Support all business sectors globally from day 1
6. Establish a 500 B2B sales model with zero backend hosting costs
7. Provide manual review/regeneration interface for quality control
8. Mobile-first interface for on-site prospecting and data entry

## 1.2 Background

> **The Problem:** Website creation is a major bottleneck in B2B sales for small businesses. Existing tools (WordPress, Wix) are slow, require extensive customization, and produce generic results. This delays sales cycles and limits your ability to prospect efficiently. Currently, creating one professional website takes a full day limiting you to 1-2 prospects per day when you could be prospecting 5-10.

> **The Opportunity:** By automating website generation using AI and sector-specific design knowledge, you can dramatically compress the creation timeline to 1 hour of unattended building. This enables a new business model: prospect a business, build their website before meeting them, and present a finished product in-person or via call for 500. Clients are far more likely to buy when they see something concrete, and your low price point creates friction-free sales.

> **Why Now:** LLM-based code generation, AI image sourcing, and free deployment (Netlify) make this technically viable and cost-effective. Your unique value is combining prospecting + generation + presentation transforming a time-consuming manual process into a repeatable, scalable system. **The key to success lies in generating highly original, visually compelling websites that make clients say "yes" immediately not generic templates they could dismiss.**
