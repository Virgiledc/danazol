## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 implemented the business data input form with all necessary fields. This story will add the core AI generation functionality that transforms the collected business data into actual website code using Claude API.

### Claude API Configuration
Based on architecture documents, the following configuration is needed:

```typescript
// Environment variables
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

// API client configuration
const claudeConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
  maxTokens: 4000,
  temperature: 0.7
}
```

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
Sector-specific prompts will be generated based on business category:

```typescript
const sectorPrompts = {
  restaurant: {
    systemPrompt: "You are a web designer creating a restaurant website...",
    designGuidelines: {
      colors: ["warm", "inviting", "food-focused"],
      typography: "serif headlines, readable body",
      imagery: "food, atmosphere, ambiance",
      vibe: "appetite-appealing, welcoming"
    }
  },
  salon: {
    systemPrompt: "You are a web designer creating a hair salon website...",
    designGuidelines: {
      colors: ["elegant", "sophisticated", "professional"],
      typography: "modern, clean",
      imagery: "before/after, styling, professional",
      vibe: "premium, trusted, relaxing"
    }
  }
  // ... other sectors
}
```

### Generated Code Structure
The API will return structured code:

```typescript
interface GeneratedCode {
  html: string
  css: string
  javascript: string
  metadata: {
    generatedAt: Date
    category: string
    imageUrls: string[]
    sections: string[]
  }
}
```

### API Route Structure
Next.js API route for Claude integration:

```
POST /api/claude/generate
Request Body:
{
  businessData: BusinessData
  regenerateSections?: string[]
}

Response:
{
  success: boolean
  code?: GeneratedCode
  error?: string
  metadata?: {
    generationTime: number
    tokensUsed: number
  }
}
```

### File Locations
Based on the monorepo structure:

```
apps/generator/src/
├── services/
│   ├── claudeService.ts          # Claude API client
│   ├── promptService.ts          # Prompt generation

```

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing strategy from architecture:

**Unit Tests:**
- Test file location: `apps/generator/src/__tests__/services/`
- Testing frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library
- Test prompt generation logic
- Test code validation functions

**Integration Tests:**
- Test Claude API calls (with mocked responses)
- Test code generation workflow
- Test error handling scenarios

**Manual Testing:**
- Test generation with different business categories
- Test error handling and recovery
- Test generated code quality and responsiveness

### Technical Constraints
- [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#2.1]
- Claude API rate limits: 5 requests per minute (free tier)
- Maximum 4000 tokens per request
- Generated code must be valid HTML/CSS/JS
- All code must use Tailwind CSS classes
- Mobile-first responsive design required

## Testing

### Test File Location
- Unit tests: `apps/generator/src/__tests__/services/`
- Integration tests: `apps/generator/src/__tests__/integration/`

### Test Standards

- MSW for API mocking

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test Claude API integration with mocked responses
- Test prompt generation for different business categories
